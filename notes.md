## Plans
- At some point will need to make a VM module. This will handle a few things like:
    - Garbage collection (ðŸ˜¬)
    - Stack and heap management
    - Call frames (~analogous to interpreter scope stack)
    - Exception handling
    - Stack unwinding

## Problems
- How to handle objects pointing to same memory? This is generally disallowed in Rust.
    - Go fully unsafe and write a wrapper class around object that holds a raw pointer underneath?
    - ~~Steal~~ Be inspired by `evmap::ShallowCopy?`
    
## Questions
- Am I using clone too much?
